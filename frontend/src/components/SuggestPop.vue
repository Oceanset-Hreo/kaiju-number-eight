            The recommendation index is an estimate based on historical data and may be affected by unforeseen factors, so it should not replace professional agricultural advice.

            How are agricultural production recommendations generated? We use three main analysis methods to generate customized agricultural production recommendations:

            <ul>
                <li>AI-based Analyzer: Like an experienced farmer, this analyzer considers your environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, and recommends the crops best suited for these conditions.
                </li>
                <li>Rule-based Analyzer: Similar to an agricultural rulebook, this analyzer contains specific rules about the optimal growing conditions for different crops. It compares your local environmental data to these rules to see which crops are the best fit.
                </li>
                <li>Statistical Analyzer: Like a land surveyor, this analyzer examines your area to understand which crops grow well there. It categorizes land based on factors such as soil type, elevation, and historical growth patterns, then recommends crops that are well-suited for your area.
                </li>
            </ul>
            By combining these three methods, we can provide you with accurate and tailored agricultural recommendations. It's like having a team of AI, rulebooks, and land surveyors working together to help you make the best planting decisions!
